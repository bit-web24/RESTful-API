# üöÄ API Usage

This is a RESTful API that allows you to interact with the application and perform various actions. The API provides endpoints to retrieve **user data** and **order data**.

# Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

* Python (version >=3.11.2)
* SQLite (version 3)

# Installation

>  `NOTE`: If you are on `windows` you should skip this step

To install the `sqlite3` module for Python, you typically don't need to install it separately because it comes bundled with the standard library of Python. However, you may need to install the appropriate `SQLite database engine and development files` for your **operating system**. Here are the general steps to install SQLite:

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) üêß:
1. Open a Terminal.
2. Install SQLite by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev python3.11-venv
```

# Project Setup

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the project.

## Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bit-web24/RESTful-API.git
```

## Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd RESTful-API
```

## Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

## Activate the virtual environment:

### For Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### For macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is: http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Authentication

Authentication is not required to access the API endpoints.

## Endpoints

### Get Users
Retrieve a list of all users.

* **Endpoint**: `/users`
* **Method**: `GET`
* **Response**: List of users in JSON format

### Get User
Retrieve a specific user by their ID.

* **Endpoint**: `/users/{id}`
* **Method**: `GET`
* **Parameters**:
    `{id}`: ID of the user to retrieve
* **Response**: User object in JSON format

### Get Orders
Retrieve a list of all orders.

* **Endpoint**: `/orders`
* **Method**: `GET`
* **Response**: List of orders in JSON format

### Get Order
Retrieve a specific order by its ID.

* **Endpoint**: `/orders/{id}`
* **Method**: `GET`
* **Parameters**:
	`{id}`: ID of the order to retrieve
* **Response**: Order object in JSON format

## Error Handling

If an error occurs while processing a request, the API will return an error response in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message"
}
```

The error field will contain a descriptive error message indicating the nature of the error.

## Status Codes

The API may return the following status codes in the responses:

* `200 OK`: The request was successful.
* `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found.
* `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.

# Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

`NOTE: Run in the RESTful-API director`
